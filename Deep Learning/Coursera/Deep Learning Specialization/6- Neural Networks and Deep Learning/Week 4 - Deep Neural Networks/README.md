# Deep Neural Networks
Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Describe the successive block structure of a deep neural network
* Build a deep L-layer neural network
* Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations
* Use a cache to pass information from forward to back propagation
* Explain the role of hyperparameters in deep learning

**This week contains:** *1 Quizz & 2 Programming Exercises*
