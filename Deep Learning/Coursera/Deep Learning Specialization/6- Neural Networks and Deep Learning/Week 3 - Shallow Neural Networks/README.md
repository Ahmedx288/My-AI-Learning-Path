# Shallow Neural Networks
Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Describe hidden units and hidden layers.
* Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh.
* Implement forward and backward propagation.
* Apply random initialization to your neural network.
* Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations.
* Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer.

**This week contains:** *1 Quizz & 1 Programming Exercise*
