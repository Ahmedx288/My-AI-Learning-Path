# ML Strategy (1)

Streamline and optimize your ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.

**Learning Objectives**
* Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important.
* Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects.
* Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset.
* Define human-level performance.
* Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects.
* Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset.

**This week contains:** *1 Case Study, **Bird Recognition in the City of Peacetopia** - 15 Questions*
