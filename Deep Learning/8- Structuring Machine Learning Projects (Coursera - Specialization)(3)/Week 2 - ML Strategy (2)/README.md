# ML Strategy (1)

Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to evaluate the most worthwhile options to pursue and gain intuition for how to split your data and when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning.

**Learning Objectives**
* Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning.
* Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets.

**This week contains:** *1 Case Study, **Autonomous Driving** - 15 Questions*
