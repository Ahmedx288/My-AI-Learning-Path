In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

Topics include:
1. **Introduction to Deep Learning.**
2. **Neural Networks Basics.**
3. **Shallow Neural Networks.**
4. **Deep Neural Networks.**
