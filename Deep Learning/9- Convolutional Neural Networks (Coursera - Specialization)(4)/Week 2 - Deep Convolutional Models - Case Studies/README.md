# Deep Convolutional Models: Case Studies

Learn about the practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs straight from the research papers.

**Learning Objectives**
* Discuss multiple foundational papers written about convolutional neural networks.
* Analyze the dimensionality reduction of a volume in a very deep network.
* Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras.
* Train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
* Implement a skip connection in your network.
* Clone a repository from github and use transfer learning.

**This week contains:** *1 Quiz & 2 Programming Exercises*
