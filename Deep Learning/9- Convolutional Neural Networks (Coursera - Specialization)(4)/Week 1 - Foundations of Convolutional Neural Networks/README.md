# Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and to stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.

**Learning Objectives**
* Explain the convolution operation.
* Apply two different types of pooling operations.
* Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose.
* Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem.

**This week contains:** *1 Quiz & 2 Programming Exercises*
