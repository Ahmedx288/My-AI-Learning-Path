Learn Python, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, Calculus, and Linear Algebra—the foundations for building your own neural network.

This program focuses on the fundamental building blocks you will need to learn in order to become an AI
practitioner. Specifically, you will learn programming skills, and essential math for building an AI
architecture. You’ll even dive into neural networks and deep learning.

Topics include:

1. **Introduction to Python**: Start coding with Python, drawing upon libraries and automation scripts to solve complex problems quickly.
2. **Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, pandas, and Matplotlib**: Learn how to use all the key tools for working with data in Python: Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, pandas, and Matplotlib.
3. **Linear Algebra Essentials**: Learn the foundational linear algebra you need for AI success: vectors, linear transformations, and matrices—as well as the linear algebra behind neural networks.
4. **Calculus Essentials**: Learn the foundations of calculus to understand how to train a neural network: plotting, derivatives, the chain rule, and more. See how these mathematical skills visually come to life with a neural network example.
5. **Neural Networks**: Gain a solid foundation in the hottest fields in AI: neural networks, deep learning, and PyTorch.
