We'll start with an overview of how machine learning models work and how they are used. This may feel basic if you've done statistical modeling or machine learning before. Don't worry, we will progress to building powerful models soon.

Topics include:

1. **How Models Work**: The first step if you're new to machine learning.

2. **Basic Data Exploration**: Load and understand your data.

3. **Your First Machine Learning Model**: Building your first model.

4. **Model Validation**: Measure the performance of your model? so you can test and compare alternatives.

5. **Underfitting and Overfitting**: Fine-tune your model for better performance.

6. **Random Forests**: Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

7. **Machine Learning Competitions**: Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress
