# Logistic Regression & Regularization
This week, we’ll be covering logistic regression. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes.

We are also covering regularization. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. We’ll introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data.
