# Support Vector Machines
This week, you will be learning about the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.

SVMs are considered by many to be the most powerful 'black box' learning algorithm, and by posing a cleverly-chosen optimization objective, one of the most widely used learning algorithms today.

**This week contains:** *1 Quizz & 1 Programming Exercise*
