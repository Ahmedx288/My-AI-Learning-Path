# Advice for Applying Machine Learning & System Design
In Week 6, you will be learning about systematically improving your learning algorithm. 

The videos for this week will teach you how to tell when a learning algorithm is doing poorly, and describe the 'best practices' for how to 'debug' your learning algorithm and go about improving its performance.

**This week contains:** *2 Quizzes & 1 Programming Exercise*
