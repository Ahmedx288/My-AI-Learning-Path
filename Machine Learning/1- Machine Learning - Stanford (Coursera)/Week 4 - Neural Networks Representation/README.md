# Neural Networks: Representation
This week, we are covering neural networks. Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works.

It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.
