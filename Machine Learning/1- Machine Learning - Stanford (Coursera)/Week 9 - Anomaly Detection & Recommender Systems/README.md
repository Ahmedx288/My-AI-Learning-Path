# Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction
This week, we will be covering anomaly detection which is widely used in fraud detection (e.g. ‘has this credit card been stolen?’). Given a large number of data points, we may sometimes want to figure out which ones vary significantly from the average.

We will also be covering recommender systems, which are used by companies like Amazon, Netflix and Apple to recommend products to their users. Recommender systems look at patterns of activities between different users and different products to produce these recommendations.
