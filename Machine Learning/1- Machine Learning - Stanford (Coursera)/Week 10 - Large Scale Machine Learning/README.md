# Large Scale Machine Learning
This week, we will be covering large scale machine learning.

Machine learning works best when there is an abundance of data to leverage for training. With the amount data that many websites/companies are gathering today, knowing how to handle ‘big data’ is one of the most sought after skills in Silicon Valley.
