# Neural Networks: Learning
In Week 5, you will be learning how to train Neural Networks.

The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turn to), and this week's videos explain the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models.

In this week's programming assignment, you'll also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for yourself.

**This week contains:** *1 Quizzes & 1 Programming Exercises*
