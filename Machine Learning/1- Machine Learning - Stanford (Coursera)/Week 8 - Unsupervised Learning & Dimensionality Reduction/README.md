# Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction
This week, you will be learning about unsupervised learning.

While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). You will learn about clusteringâ€”which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.

Also in this week, we introduce Principal Components Analysis, and show how it can be used for data compression to speed up learning algorithms as well as for visualizations of complex datasets.
